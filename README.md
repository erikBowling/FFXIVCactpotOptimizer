# FFXIVCactpotOptimizer
The program generates random mini cactpot puzzles from FFXIV, and finds the choice with the highest average payout.

This console application is very simple. All it does is calculate the highest average payout per pickable row of the FFXIV cactpot game.
It allows the user to create their own boards or generate random ones. Currently, the created boards can crash given the wrong kinds of input.
I will be changing that soon.
